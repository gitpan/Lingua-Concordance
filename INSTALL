INSTALL

Installing this module should be trivial since it requires no
dependencies:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

Once installed, you should be able to use the concordance.pl script
found in the bin directory. Sample data, walden.txt, is found in the etc
directory. Try searching for human.
